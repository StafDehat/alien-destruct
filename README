Lots of assumptions here.
alien-destruct.cpp will run on an Arduino Mega.  Its "piPin" will power up
  a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  That Pi will run light-fog.sh.
Lots of IoT relays involved, etc.  Mario gets it.  No one else matters.


NOTE: The light-fog.sh script *must* run as user root, because it requires
  root permissions to access /sys/class/gpio/...

Place light-fog.sh somewhere.  Doesn't matter where, but you'll need to know
  specifically where, for the purposes of calling it via cron later.  For
  the sake of example, let's say it's /root/light-fog.sh

Ensure light-fog.sh is executable:
  # chmod +x /root/light-fog.sh

As user 'root', edit your crontab:
  # crontab -e

Add these two lines:
@reboot    /root/light-fog.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null
* * * * *  /root/light-fog.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null

Don't forget to save & quit your crontab.

That's it.


Note: The light-fog.sh script, once launched, should run forever.
We cron it for "@reboot" so it starts automatically as soon as the
Pi boots.  Alternatively, you could call it directly vi
"/etc/rc.local", or create a SysVInit/Upstart/SystemD/etc job to
launch it for you.  You can do all or none of those - it doesn't
matter.  The script contains a non-concurrency wrapper, so there
will only ever be 1 instance of the script running at a time, no
matter how many times you try launching it.  That's also why we
cron it to start every 1 minute - that's just insurance, in case
the script dies (ie: is killed).
Long story short, just launch it, somehow, on boot.
